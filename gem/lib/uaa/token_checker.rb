# This class is for Resource Servers to decode an access token through
# an HTTP endpoint on the Authorization Server.

# Resource servers get tokens and need to validate and decode
# them. This class is for Resource Servers which can accept an opaque
# token from the Authorization Server and can make a call to the
# /check_token endpoint to validate the token.

  # Create a new instance of the token checker. Attributes:
  #
  # * target - the target base URL of the Authorization Server
  #
  # * client_id - the id of the client or Resource Server (known to the
  # Authorization Server), used to authenticate with the /check_token endpoint
  #
  # * client_secret - the shared secret used to authenticate with
  # the /check_token endpoint.
  #
  # * audience_ids - an array or space separated strings and should
  # indicate values which indicate the token is intended for this service
  # instance. It will be compared with tokens as they are decoded to
  # ensure that the token was intended for this audience.
